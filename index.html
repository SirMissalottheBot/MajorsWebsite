<p>
  Major is seven year old border collie, from working stock. Major's sire was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheepdog_trial">sheepdog trial</a> champion.
 He has short hair and loves chasing the flirt pole or playing fetch in the local field.
  </p>
    <p>
   Major likes dogs more than people and gets excited whenever he meets new four‑legged friends on his walks. After a long run, he enjoys kicking back and relaxing in the local pub, where he happily curls up under the table. He’s a loyal, fun dog who brings a lot of joy to everyone who meets him.
